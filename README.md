# Omakubora

Omakubora is a fork of Omakub, an excellent project from omakub.org. Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakubora. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakubora is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
